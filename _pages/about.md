Hi! I'm a PhD Candidate at Harvard, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor Krzysztof Gajos.

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of HCI and Responsible AI. I design, build, and evaluate AI-powered systems for decision-making support.

I spent two wonderful summers interning at Microsoft Research, where I was hosted by Dr. Saleema Amershi & Dr. Alexandra Olteanu in 2021 and Dr. Jennifer Wortman Vaughan & Dr. Alexandra Chouldechova in 2022.

My research is currently supported by an IBM fellowship. Prior to joining the Intelligent Interactive Systems group at Harvard as a PhD student, I was a member of the Intelligent User Interfaces Lab and the Multimedia, Vision & Graphics Lab at Koc University in Turkey, from where I obtained my master's degree in 2019. I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Izmir Institute of Technology in 2016. Originally, I come from the capital city of a small country in southeastern Europe - Prishtina, Kosovo.
