Hi there! I'm a PhD Candidate at Harvard, where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Krzysztof Gajos](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~kgajos/).

My research interests lie primarily at the intersection of HCI and Responsible AI. I design, build, and evaluate AI-powered systems for decision-making support.

During my PhD, I spent two wonderful summers interning at Microsoft Research, where I was hosted by Dr. [Saleema Amershi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T0qnS1oAAAAJ&hl=en) & Dr. [Alexandra Olteanu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8IjN_vgAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2021 and Dr. [Jennifer Wortman Vaughan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YRPveMcAAAAJ&hl=en) & Dr. [Alexandra Chouldechova](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uoDW9hkAAAAJ&hl=en) in 2022.

My research has been supported by an [IBM PhD Fellowship](https://research.ibm.com/university/awards/fellowships-awardees.html) and a [Siebel Scholarship](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240920559594/en/Siebel-Scholars-Foundation-Announces-Class-of-2025). 

Prior to joining the [Intelligent Interactive Systems](https://iis.seas.harvard.edu/) group at Harvard as a PhD student, I obtained a master's degree in Computer Science from [Koc University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) in Istanbul, Turkey, and a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Izmir Institute of Technology](https://en.iyte.edu.tr/) in Izmir, Turkey. 

I was born and raised in the capital city of a small country in southeastern Europe - Prishtina, Kosovo.
